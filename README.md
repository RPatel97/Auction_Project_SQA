Phase #2

To run phase 2 follow the steps below.

Step 1: Navigate to the SQA folder, in the terminal

Step 2: enter the command make
    This command will build the files and output an executable named Auction

Step 3: in the command line enter ./Auction
    This will run the executable

While in the program:

    In order to login, type "login" as first command then press enter, when prompted to, enter username as "admin01".

    Only 2 users have been implemented as this is just as rapid prototype

    After login is successful, any command entered will result in the end of the system for now as, no commands have been implemented.
